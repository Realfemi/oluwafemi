# terraform-lb


First, install terraform with chocolatey package manager


Run terraform from the same directory as where you have the terraform code

terraform init
terraform plan (to confirm if the configurations are exactly what you want and to see if you have made any mistakes)
terraform apply

If you need to delete the infrastructure afterwards, use terraform destroy
